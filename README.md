# An Interferon-stimulated long non-coding RNA USP30-AS1 regulates antiviral immunity in influenza virus infection
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are groups of regulators that modulate or control biological processes of importance, including inflammation and antiviral immunity. However, what we know about lncRNAs in influenza A virus (IAV) infection induced immune response is limited. By performing a series of virological and biological assays together with bioinformatical approaches, we discovered an interferon-stimulated lncRNA USP30-AS1 as a vital immune regulator that engages inflammatory response in IAV infection.

# Methods
- Trim Galore is a wrapper around Cutadapt and FastQC to consistently apply adapter and quality trimming to FastQ files, with extra functionality for RRBS data.
- HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) to a population of human genomes as well as to a single reference genome.

GTF: https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.91.gtf.gz
```
- featureCounts is a program that counts how many reads map to genomic features, such as genes, exon, promoter and genomic bins.
