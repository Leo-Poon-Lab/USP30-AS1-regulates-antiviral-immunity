# An Interferon-stimulated long non-coding RNA USP30-AS1 regulates antiviral immunity in influenza virus infection
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are groups of regulators that modulate or control biological processes of importance, including inflammation and antiviral immunity. However, what we know about lncRNAs in influenza A virus (IAV) infection induced immune response is limited. By performing a series of virological and biological assays together with bioinformatical approaches, we discovered an interferon-stimulated lncRNA USP30-AS1 as a vital immune regulator that engages inflammatory response in IAV infection.

# RNAswarm
RNAswarm is a tool for analyzing SPLASH data. It is a Nextflow pipeline that:
- Trims (with `fastp`) and maps (with `segemehl`) chimeric reads to a reference genome.
- Generate heatmaps of interactions between viral segments or/and host transcripts.
- Compare groups or mutants to identify differentially structured regions (with `DESeq2`)
- Generate circos plots of potential interactions and potential differentially structured regions.
